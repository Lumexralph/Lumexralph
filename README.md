- Currently building MLOps skills in deploying and managing Machine Learning models and workloads in production, I have completed [ML Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng](https://coursera.org/share/382f45cbe473cf5539fc6aa91d12cd73) and currently started Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera just to build a solid mental model about building and developing machine learning models and associated machine algorithms.
- Worked as a Go open-source contributor in Mattermost, Pomerium, and Pion.
- Currently a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead at Fathom.
